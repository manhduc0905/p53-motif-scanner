# Universal DNA Motif Scanner

Project Overview: A statistical bioinformatics web application that identifies and visualizes transcription factor binding sites in DNA sequences.

Core Logic: Uses Position Weight Matrices (PWMs) from the JASPAR database to calculate binding affinity.

Statistical Rigor: Implements Monte Carlo simulations to calculate P-values and applies dynamic GC-content background correction to eliminate false positives.

Tech Stack: Python, Streamlit, Biopython, Matplotlib, Pandas.
